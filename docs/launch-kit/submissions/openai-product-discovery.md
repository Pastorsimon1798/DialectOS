- MCP server with 17 tools for Claude Desktop, Cursor, and MCP clients
- Structure-preserving markdown translation (tables, code blocks, links)
- i18n locale file diff/merge
- Gender-neutral language support (elles, latine, -e/-x)
- Adversarial quality gates (semantic drift, negation preservation, structure validation)

DialectOS is the first MCP server specifically built for Spanish dialects. Unlike generic translation APIs that treat Spanish as one language, DialectOS understands 25 regional variants with different vocabulary, grammar, and formality levels.
