# Product Hunt Launch Kit

**Launch day:** Tuesday (highest engagement day)
**Launch time:** 12:01 AM PT (right when the day starts)

## Product Info

**Name:** DialectOS
**Tagline:** The first MCP server for Spanish dialects — 25 variants, quality gates, structure preservation
**Description:**

DialectOS is an source-available Spanish dialect translation server that runs as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool and CLI. It translates English and other languages into 25 regional Spanish variants while preserving markdown structure, enforcing glossary terms, and applying adversarial quality gates that catch semantic drift before it reaches users.

**Topics:** Developer Tools, AI, source-available, Translation
**Website:** https://kyanitelabs.github.io/DialectOS
**GitHub:** https://github.com/KyaniteLabs/DialectOS

## Maker Comment (First Comment)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

Simon here, builder of DialectOS.

We built this after a real production incident: we shipped Spain Spanish to Mexico, and users thought we were being intentionally rude. That's when we learned that "Spanish" is not one language — it's 25 regional variants with different vocabulary, grammar, and formality levels.

**Three things I'm most proud of:**

1. **MCP-native** — DialectOS isn't a web app you copy-paste into. It's 17 tools that Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any MCP client can use natively.

2. **Adversarial quality gates** — We don't trust translations blindly. If "Do not click" becomes "Haz clic" (the opposite meaning), it's auto-rejected. We maintain a corpus of semantic traps and run them against every release.

3. **automated tests for v0.3.0** — We test harder than we market. Grammar detection (voseo, leísmo, laísmo), semantic backstop, translation memory torture tests — everything is tested.

**Tech stack:** TypeScript monorepo, pnpm workspace, 7 packages, stdio MCP.

Would love your feedback on the architecture, the quality gate design, or any Spanish localization horror stories you have. 🙏
