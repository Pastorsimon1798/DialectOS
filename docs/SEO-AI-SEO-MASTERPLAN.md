## 📊 Part 1: BRUTAL AUDIT — What's Missing Right Now

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Fix Today)

| # | Issue | Why It Hurts | Fix Effort |

| 4 | **CITATION.cff says MIT license** | Actual repo license is BSL-1.1. Academic confusion + legal mismatch. | Credibility hit | 2 min |
| 5 | **CITATION.cff says "20 variants"** | README says 25. Inconsistency signals sloppiness to LLMs. | Trust erosion | 2 min |

### 🟡 HIGH (Fix This Week)

| # | Issue | Why It Hurts | Fix Effort |

### 🟢 AI SEO / LLMO — THE FUTURE (Fix This Month)

| # | Issue | Why It Hurts | Fix Effort |
|---|-------|-------------|------------|
| 21 | **No Wikidata entry** | LLMs use Wikidata for entity resolution. No entry = invisible entity. | Models don't know you exist | 2 hrs |

```

### PHASE 2: README Optimization (This Week, ~3 hours)

**Add a crystal-clear "What is DialectOS?" paragraph at the very top** (LLMs extract this):

```markdown
DialectOS is an source-available Spanish dialect translation server that runs as an MCP
(Model Context Protocol) tool and CLI. It translates English and other languages into
25 regional Spanish variants — Mexican, Argentinian, Colombian, Puerto Rican, and more —
while preserving markdown structure, enforcing glossary terms, and applying adversarial
quality gates that catch semantic drift before it reaches users.
```

**Add an FAQ section** (Answer Engine Optimization):

```markdown
## ❓ FAQ

**What is DialectOS?**
DialectOS is an source-available translation engine for Spanish regional dialects. It runs as
an MCP server (for AI assistants like Claude) and a CLI tool.

**How is DialectOS different from Google Translate?**
Google Translate treats Spanish as one language. DialectOS understands 25 regional
variants, preserves markdown structure, enforces glossaries, and applies quality gates.

**What are Spanish dialects?**
Spanish varies significantly by country. Mexican Spanish uses "carro" for car; Spain uses
"coche"; Argentina uses "auto". DialectOS handles these differences automatically.

**Does DialectOS work with ChatGPT / Claude?**
Yes. DialectOS is an MCP server, so Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP clients can
use its 17 translation tools natively.

**Is DialectOS free?**
Yes. It's licensed under BSL 1.1 (free for most use) and becomes Apache-2.0 in 2030.

**What is MCP?**
Model Context Protocol is an open standard that lets AI assistants use external tools.
DialectOS exposes 17 translation tools through MCP.
```

**Add a "Built with DialectOS" badge**:
```markdown
[![Translated with DialectOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/translated%20with-DialectOS-d89b2b)](https://github.com/KyaniteLabs/DialectOS)
```

**Add comparison table** (LLMs LOVE these):

```markdown
## 🆚 DialectOS vs Alternatives

| Feature | Google Translate | DeepL | DialectOS |
|---------|----------------|-------|-----------|
| Spanish dialects | 1 (generic) | ~5 | **25** |
| MCP integration | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Markdown preservation | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| i18n locale support | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Gender-neutral output | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Quality gates | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🎯 Part 4: THE SECRET WEAPONS

### Secret Weapon #1: The "Jugo de China" Meme
The Puerto Rican "orange juice → jugo de china" example is *perfect* for virality. It's concrete, surprising, and instantly understandable. Use it everywhere:
- Tweet: "We asked Google Translate for Puerto Rican Spanish. It gave us 'jugo de naranja.' The correct term is 'jugo de china.' This is why we built DialectOS."
- Hacker News title hook
- Product Hunt gallery image #1
- Dev.to article opener

### Secret Weapon #2: The MCP Angle
MCP is THE hottest topic in AI tooling right now (April 2026). Being "the first MCP server for Spanish dialects" is a massive differentiator. Lean into it HARD:
- All headlines should mention MCP
- Compare against non-MCP translation tools
- Target MCP-specific communities (r/mcp, MCP Discord, etc.)

### Secret Weapon #3: The 746 Tests Badge
Your test count is insane for a 0.1.0 project. Flaunt it:
- "automated tests passing" badge in README
- "More tests than stars" self-deprecating tweet
- "We test harder than we market" — use as a brand voice

### Secret Weapon #4: The BSL → Apache License
The license conversion date (2030-04-20) is a built-in news hook:
- "Open sourcing in 2030" creates FOMO
- "Free now, fully open later" is a compelling narrative
- Write a blog post about why you chose BSL

### Secret Weapon #5: The Certification Business
The $500 Spanish Launch Certification is a brilliant dual-purpose tool:
- Revenue stream (proves demand)
- Content goldmine (every audit = case study)
- Social proof ("We certified Acme SaaS for Mexican Spanish")
- Backlinks (customers link to you)

## 🔬 Part 6: AI SEO DEEP DIVE — How LLMs Actually Decide to Recommend You

### What LLMs Know About DialectOS (Current)
Based on training data cutoffs, here's what models likely know:
- ✅ The GitHub repo exists (in training data if indexed before cutoff)
- ✅ Basic description from README (if repo was in training corpus)
- ❌ Nothing about MCP integration (too new)
- ❌ Nothing about quality gates (too specific)
- ❌ Nothing about the 25 dialects detail
- ❌ Nothing about the certification business

### How to Fix This

**1. Train the Models on Your Content**
LLMs don't browse the live web. They train on snapshots. To be recommended:
- Get your content into sources they train on (Common Crawl, GitHub, arXiv, Wikipedia, Wikidata)
- The more times your exact description appears across sources, the higher the recall

**2. Be in the Right Contextual Neighborhood**
LLMs recommend by association. If your name appears near:
- "best spanish translation tools"
- "mcp servers for developers"
- "i18n localization tools"
- "source-available translation"
...you'll be recommended for those queries.

**3. Create Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Hooks**
When models use RAG (real-time search), they index:
- Your README (if well-structured)
- Your docs site (if indexed)
- Articles mentioning you (if published recently)
- Structured data (schema.org)

**4. The Entity Loop**
```
Wikidata entry → Wikipedia mention (eventually) → 
Academic citations → Blog mentions → 
Awesome list inclusions → LLM training data → 
LLM recommendations → Users → More mentions → 
Stronger entity → Better recommendations
```

**5. Monitor with LLM Recall Testing**
Every week, ask ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity:
- "What are the best tools for Spanish dialect translation?"
- "What MCP servers are available for translation?"
- "How do I translate my app to Mexican Spanish?"
- "What are good source-available i18n tools for Spanish?"

Track whether DialectOS is mentioned. If not, publish more content targeting those exact queries.

---

## 💰 Part 7: THE BUSINESS MODEL AMPLIFIER

SEO isn't just about stars. It's about revenue. Here's how SEO feeds the certification business:

```
SEO Traffic → GitHub Stars → Social Proof → 
Certification Inquiries → Paid Audits → 
Case Studies → More SEO Content → More Traffic
```

**Specific SEO → Revenue Hooks:**
1. "Spanish Launch Certification" page → ranks for "spanish localization audit"
2. "Sample Customer Report" → ranks for "spanish translation quality report"
3. Blog posts about specific dialects → rank for "mexican spanish translation service"
4. Comparison content → ranks for "best spanish translation tool for business"

Every piece of SEO content should have a CTA to the certification offer.
