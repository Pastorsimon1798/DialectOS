# KyaniteLabs Engineering Rules

This file is loaded automatically by Claude Code when working in any KyaniteLabs repository. It supplements the global rules in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

## Organization Principles

- **Local-first when it matters** — keep data, creative work, and knowledge close to the people who own it
- **Useful over flashy** — solve real workflow problems
- **Human-in-the-loop by design** — AI accelerates judgment, it doesn't erase it
- **Open where it helps** — public projects are documented for discovery and reuse
- **Craft matters** — README quality, tests, and maintenance are part of the product

## Issue-Driven Development

All contributions to KyaniteLabs repos flow through GitHub issues.

### Workflow

```
External contributor opens issue
  → Template applies: bug/enhancement + needs-triage label
  → Maintainer reviews, adds: approved label
  → Auto-triage promotes to: agent-ready label
  → Pipeline picks up → creates fix PR

Owner/member (simongonzalezdc) opens issue
  → Auto-triage detects member author
  → Promotes directly to agent-ready (skips triage)
  → Pipeline picks up → creates fix PR
```

### Label System

| Label | Meaning | Who sets it |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `needs-triage` | New issue, awaiting review | Issue template (auto) |
| `approved` | Maintainer approved for work | Maintainer (manual) |
| `agent-ready` | Ready for pipeline to pick up | Auto-triage (auto) |
| `bug` | Bug report | Issue template (auto) |
| `enhancement` | Feature request | Issue template (auto) |
| `repo-pipeline` | Created by pipeline scanner | Pipeline (auto) |
| `ci-failure` | CI broke on main branch | Pipeline (auto) |
| `severity:low/medium/high/critical` | Impact level | Pipeline (auto) |

### Rules for Agents Creating Issues

- Never create issues without the `repo-pipeline` label
- Always include reproduction steps or evidence
- Set severity based on: does it break main? does it affect users? is it cosmetic?
- Link to the relevant CI run, commit, or file

## Pipeline Awareness

The GITHUB_pipeline runs a triage cycle every 30 minutes. When working in KyaniteLabs repos, be aware:

1. **Your PRs will be monitored** by `pr-maintainer.py` — it fixes CI failures, rebases, and addresses review comments
2. **Do not delete `fix/issue-*` branches** — the pipeline manages these
3. **Pipeline-created issues** have the `repo-pipeline` label — treat them as real issues
4. **Circuit breaker** — if the pipeline enters RED state, all automated work stops until manually reset
5. **Issue priority** — pipeline sorts by severity (critical > high > medium > low), then by age

## CI Standards

All KyaniteLabs repos must have these CI checks (via GitHub Actions on Blacksmith runners):

### Required Checks (must pass before merge)

| Check | Tool | Config |
|-------|------|--------|
| Lint | ruff | `ruff check . && ruff format --check .` |
| Test | pytest | `pytest --tb=short -q` |
| Build | pip install | `pip install -e .` (Python) or equivalent |

### Recommended Checks (add when applicable)

| Check | Tool | When |
|-------|------|------|
| Security scan | bandit + pip-audit | Python repos |
| Type check | mypy | repos with type annotations |
| Docker build | docker build | repos with Dockerfile |
| Package surface | custom script | published packages |
| Compatibility matrix | multi-Python/Node | public packages |

### CI Rules

- All CI runs on `blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2404` runners
- CI must pass on all supported Python/Node versions
- Never skip CI (`--no-verify`) — if it fails, fix the root cause
- CI failures on main get auto-detected by the pipeline

## Branch Protection

All `main`/`master` branches in KyaniteLabs repos are protected:

- No direct pushes — everything through PRs
- Required status checks must pass
- Branches must be up-to-date before merge
- Force pushes blocked
- Linear history required (squash or rebase merge)

## Repository Standards

### Python Repos
- **Formatter**: ruff (not black)
- **Linter**: ruff
- **Config**: `pyproject.toml` (not setup.py/setup.cfg)
- **Python**: minimum 3.11, test on 3.11 and latest
- **Dependencies**: pin exact versions

### Node/TypeScript Repos
- **Package manager**: pnpm (not npm/yarn)
- **Formatter**: prettier
- **Linter**: eslint

### All Repos
- **README.md**: Must explain what it is, how to run it, how to test it
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Updated with every release
- **LICENSE**: MIT (org default)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Points to org contributing guide

## Git Workspace Hygiene

Agents must leave the repository in the same clean state they found it. No exceptions.

- **Delete feature branches** after merge — whether you merged via PR or locally. A merged branch that still exists is a failure.
- **Remove worktrees** when done. If you created a git worktree for isolated work, remove it when the work is complete or abandoned. No orphaned worktrees.
- **Clean up stale references** — prune remote-tracking branches that no longer exist upstream (`git remote prune origin`).
- **No abandoned work left behind** — if you started a branch, pushed it, and then the task was cancelled or superseded, delete the branch. Dead branches accumulate and confuse everyone.
- **Local branches stay current** — regularly rebase local tracking branches against their upstream. If a local branch has diverged and is no longer needed, delete it.
- **Worktree state matches intent** — if you're done with a task, the working directory should be clean (`git status` shows nothing). Staged changes, untracked files, and modified files from abandoned work are not acceptable.

The rule is simple: finish your work, merge or discard it, clean up every artifact you created. The main branch is the only permanent artifact. Everything else is temporary and must be treated as such.

## Epoch Data Tracking

Every project must use Epoch (KyaniteLabs/Epoch) for time estimation and actively feed it data. Epoch only becomes useful when it has real estimate-vs-actual data from real projects.

### What This Means
- **Before starting a task**, get a time estimate from Epoch (via MCP, REST API at `localhost:3099`, or CLI)
- **After completing a task**, record the actual time spent using `record_actual` or `POST /v1/feedback/record-actual`
- **Include context** — task type, complexity, tools used, anything that helps the model learn
- **Batch submissions are fine** — use `batch_record_actuals` for multiple estimates at once

### Integration
- MCP: add `@puenteworks/epoch` to your project's `.mcp.json`
- REST API: `epoch serve --port 3099`
- CLI: `npx @puenteworks/epoch pert-estimate ...`

### Why This Is Non-Negotiable
Epoch's accuracy improves with data. Without estimate-vs-actual feedback from real projects, it's just a calculator with uncalibrated assumptions. Every project that uses Epoch and reports back makes every other project's estimates better. This is a collective intelligence system — it only works if everyone contributes.

The data stored in `~/.epoch/` (estimates.jsonl + feedback.jsonl) is the project's most valuable asset. Protect it, back it up, and keep feeding it.

## Agent Coordination

When multiple agents work on the same repo:

1. **Claim your scope** — note in the issue which files/areas you're working on
2. **Don't edit files another agent is actively modifying** — check open PRs first
3. **Rebase frequently** — pull from main before pushing to avoid conflicts
4. **Test before pushing** — run the same CI checks locally first
5. **Communicate via issues** — leave comments on issues for context, not in code

## Empower the Orchestrator

This repository is governed by the Empower Orchestrator law. Every top-level/orchestrator Claude Code session is an audition to improve the system, not only finish the current task.

When you notice a repeatable task done 3+ times or a recurring agent failure mode, consider shipping the smallest durable artifact that prevents the repetition: a tool, skill, slash command, hook, guardrail, memory entry, test, verifier, or doctrine doc.

This applies to top-level/orchestrator sessions. Background workers execute their assigned slice and do not independently widen scope.

Before dispatching automation or creating a durable system change, state the four-question blast-radius check in chat:

1. Scale: one file/workspace/all sessions?
2. Severity: minor friction/broken workflow/data loss or leaked content?
3. Reversibility: single revert/manual cleanup/surgery?
4. Predictability: bounded failure mode/guessing/unknown?

All green permits auto mode. Any yellow requires inline human approval. Any red means do not dispatch; do the work inline or escalate.

Worker discipline: isolated worktree/sandbox, one artifact equals one commit/change unit, verify before commit, register through the target tool's native discovery surface, and never write outside the assigned scope.

Success line: “I noticed X, found a better way. The system just got an upgrade.”
